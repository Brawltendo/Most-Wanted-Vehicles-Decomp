# Most Wanted Vehicles Decomp
A WIP matching decompilation of Need for Speed Most Wanted's vehicle physics. This is NOT usable or pretty code, nor does it compile to a full program; you'll find a lot of instances where code was only written a certain way so that it would compile to matching assembly (along with a lot of `volatile` abuse). This is all purely for research purposes. Original code belongs to Electronic Arts.

# Decompilation requirements
If you want to decompile and match functions for yourself, you'll need to install a copy of Visual Studio .NET 2003, since Most Wanted was compiled using MSVC 7.1. Once that's installed, execute `devenv_setup.ps1`. If you've installed VS2003 somewhere other than the default location, just change the path in the script to your install location. Then once you're ready to compile, run `compile_and_gen_asm.ps1` with the relative path to your cpp file within `../speed/indep/src`, or else the compiler will fail if you try to include anything. For example, `.\compile_and_gen_asm.ps1 .\physics\behaviors\chassis.cpp` will compile any functions inside `chassis.cpp` and any functions from included files, and it'll also generate an asm file with the corresponding assembly. Then from there you can grab your favorite differ and the original function's assembly and compare away!
